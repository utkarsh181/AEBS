#+TITLE: Arch-Emacs Bootstrapping Script

* Introduction

AEBS is a python script which tries to bootstrap a Emacs based system
on top on Arch Linux.  By default AEBS install my dotfiles which are
also geared toward Emacs friendly environment.

Even if you are not a Emacs user you can use AEBS to bootstrap your Arch
Linux installation as it was made to make my Arch Linux installation process
less time consuming.

* Installation 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/utkarsh181/AEBS
  cd AEBS
  python main.py
#+END_SRC

That's it.

Above command will run the =main.py= file which will further present a
simple command line interface to guide you through the installation.

* Options

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ python main.py -h
  usage: main.py [-h] [-r DOTFILES] [-p PROGRAM] [-a AUR_HELPER]

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -r DOTFILES, --dotfiles DOTFILES
			  dotfiles repo (local files or url)
    -p PROGRAM, --program PROGRAM
			  dependencies and program csv (local file or url)
    -a AUR_HELPER, --aur_helper AUR_HELPER
			  AUR helper (must have pacman like syntax)
#+END_SRC

Just like every good program AEBS also tries to be modular.  It takes
several options to choose =dotfile repo=, =aur helper name= etc.
